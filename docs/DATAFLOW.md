### **Updated Dataflow**

#### **High-Level Overview**

1. **Frontend:**

   - **Form Input:**
     - Users fill out a form with details like track title, ...
     - The form is managed using React state (`useState`) and a custom hook (`useMusicForm`) for validation and submission.
   - **Spotify Search Integration:**
     - As users type in the `trackTitle` or `artistName` fields, the Spotify API is queried for suggestions.
     - A dropdown menu allows users to select a track, autofilling relevant form fields.
   - **Visualization:**
     - Tracks are fetched from the backend and displayed in two interactive visualizations:
       - **MoodActivityChart**: Visualizes the relationship between activities and moods.
       - **MoodEnergyScatter**: Displays energy levels and durations of tracks.

2. **Backend:**

   - **Data Storage:**
     - Tracks submitted via the form are validated and stored in a MongoDB database.
   - **Data Retrieval:**
     - Stored tracks are fetched and served to the frontend through RESTful API endpoints.

3. **Output:**
   - The fetched data is displayed in the visualizations and can also be updated or removed via frontend actions.

#### **Detailed Dataflow**

##### **1. Spotify Search Integration**

- **Description:**

  - Implements a seamless Spotify API search experience, allowing users to search for tracks by title or artist.

- **Frontend Process:**

  1. User types into the `trackTitle` or `artistName` fields in the form.
  2. `SpotifySearchInput` invokes the `useSpotifySearch` hook to query the backend proxy.
  3. The query processes and fetches results from the Spotify API.
  4. Filtered results are returned to the frontend and displayed in a dropdown menu.
  5. User selects a track, autofilling relevant form fields like `trackTitle`, `artistName`, and `duration`.

##### **2. Frontend: Form Submission**

- **Description:**

  - Enables users to submit track data for storage in the backend.

- **Process:**
  1. User completes the form and clicks submit.
  2. Data is validated on the frontend via `useMusicForm`.
  3. Valid data is sent via a POST request to `/api/tracks`.
  4. Backend validates the request and stores the track in MongoDB.
  5. Success or error messages are displayed to the user.

##### **3. Data Visualization**

- **Description:**

  - Provides users with dynamic visualizations of track data.

- **Visualization Components:**

  1. **MoodActivityChart**:
     - Displays a stacked bar chart showing moods categorized by activity.
     - Uses D3.js for rendering and includes tooltips and legends for enhanced usability.
  2. **MoodEnergyScatter**:
     - Visualizes energy levels and durations as a scatter plot.
     - Incorporates interactive tooltips and legends.

- **Frontend Process:**

  1. Data is fetched from the backend via `useFetchTracks`.
  2. Data is passed to visualization components.
  3. D3.js renders the charts using helper functions like `drawAxes`, `addTooltip`, and `drawLegend`.

- **Backend Process:**
  1. GET request to `/api/tracks` retrieves all stored tracks.
  2. Tracks are sent to the frontend in JSON format.

GET Request <-- useFetchTracks Hook <-- Visualization Page <-- Rendered Track Data
```

#### **Error Handling**

1. **Spotify Search:**

   - Frontend: Displays errors if the Spotify API returns an invalid response or no results.
   - Backend: Validates query parameters and handles expired tokens gracefully.

2. **Form Validation:**

   - Frontend: Highlights invalid fields with detailed error messages.
   - Backend: Rejects invalid submissions with descriptive error responses.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Handles empty or incomplete datasets by displaying fallback messages or placeholder graphics.
