### **Updated Dataflow**

### **High-Level Overview:**

1. **Frontend:**

   - **Form Input:**
     - The user fills out a form with details such as track title, artist, album, etc.
     - Input is managed using React state (`useState`) and custom hooks (`useMusicForm`).
   - **Spotify Search Integration:**
     - As the user types in the artist or track field, the Spotify API is queried for dynamic suggestions.
     - The user can select a track from a dropdown, which autofills the form fields.
   - **Visualization:**
     - Tracks are fetched from the backend and displayed using an interactive visualization.

2. **Backend:**

   - **Spotify Proxy:**
     - The backend acts as a proxy for the Spotify API via `/api/spotify/search` to secure API credentials.
   - **Data Storage:**
     - Validated data is stored in MongoDB after a successful POST request.
   - **Data Retrieval:**
     - Tracks are fetched from MongoDB and served to the frontend via GET requests.

3. **Output:**
   - Fetched data is used for visualization or further processing on the frontend.

### **Updated Detailed Dataflow**

#### **1. Spotify Search Integration**

- **Description:**

  - While typing in the `trackTitle` or `artistName` fields in the form, the Spotify API is queried through a backend proxy.

- **Process:**
  - The user enters text in the input field.
  - The `SpotifySearchInput` component invokes the `useSpotifySearch` hook, which makes a request to the backend.
  - The backend queries the Spotify API and returns filtered results.
  - Search results are displayed in a dropdown menu.
  - When the user selects a track, the corresponding fields in the form are autofilled.

#### **2. Frontend: Form Submission**

- **Unchanged:**
  - The form data is sent to the backend via a POST request. The backend validates the data and stores it in the database.

---

#### **3. Backend: Spotify Proxy**

- **Description:**

  - A new `/api/spotify/search` endpoint acts as a proxy to fetch data from the Spotify API and pass it to the frontend.

- **Process:**
  - The backend validates the incoming request and appends a valid Spotify access token.
  - The Spotify API is queried for matching tracks based on the user's input.
  - Results are structured and returned to the frontend for display in the dropdown.
