## **Processes**

This document provides a detailed overview of the processes in the application, including workflows, data flow, deployment, and design patterns. It also highlights how SOLID principles are applied throughout the codebase.

### **1. Application Workflows**

#### **User Workflow**

1. The user accesses the application via a web browser.
2. Users can:
   - Submit track details through a form.
   - Search for tracks using the Spotify API integration.
   - View visualized data (charts) based on stored and retrieved track details.
3. Data submission triggers backend validation and storage in MongoDB.
4. Visualization charts dynamically update based on fetched data.

#### **Data Flow**

1. **Frontend**:
   - User input is handled through React components and custom hooks.
   - Data is submitted to the backend through `POST` requests.
   - Visualization components fetch and render data using `GET` requests.
2. **Backend**:
   - Data validation is performed using Mongoose schemas.
   - API routes handle CRUD operations.
   - Data is securely stored in MongoDB and retrieved on demand.
3. **External API**:
   - Results from Spotify are structured and sent to the frontend.

### **2. Middleware**

1. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Used for routes requiring Spotify API access or user authentication.
2. **Error Handling Middleware**:
   - Centralized middleware for consistent error responses.
   - Captures unexpected errors and ensures a user-friendly response.
3. **Request Logging Middleware**:
   - Logs incoming requests, including methods and endpoints, for debugging purposes.

---

### **3. Deployment Process**

1. **Frontend**:
   - Build the React application using `npm run build`.
   - Deploy static files via an Express route or a CDN.
2. **Backend**:
   - Deploy the Node.js application to a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).
   - Ensure MongoDB is set up and connected via a secure URI.
3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Configure `.env` file with sensitive credentials:
     - Spotify API keys.
     - MongoDB connection string.
     - Application port.

### **4. Design Principles and Patterns**

#### **Applied SOLID Principles**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   - Each module or class has one responsibility.
   - Examples:
     - `trackModel.js`: Handles MongoDB schema definition.
     - `tracksController.js`: Handles logic for CRUD operations on tracks.
     - `SpotifySearchInput.jsx`: Focuses only on Spotify search integration.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   - Code is open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Example:
     - Visualization components (`MoodActivityChart` and `MoodEnergyScatter`) are highly configurable and accept props for dynamic scaling and customization.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   - Components and classes can be replaced with their derived counterparts without breaking functionality.
   - Example:
     - `FormField` component in the frontend supports various input types (`text`, `select`, etc.) without requiring changes to its parent components.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   - Interfaces are split into smaller, more specific contracts.
   - Example:
     - Separate API routes (`tracksRoutes.js` and `spotifyRoutes.js`) for handling distinct functionalities.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
   - Example:
     - `dbConnect.js` abstracts database connection logic, allowing easy replacement if MongoDB is switched out.

#### **Design Patterns**

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:

   - Backend follows the MVC architecture:
     - **Models** (`trackModel.js`): Define data schema.
     - **Controllers** (`tracksController.js`): Contain logic for handling API requests.
     - **Routes** (`tracksRoutes.js`): Map HTTP requests to controllers.

2. **Observer Pattern**:

   - React state management observes changes in user input and updates the UI dynamically.

3. **Factory Pattern**:
   - Used in `useMusicForm` to dynamically create form fields based on a configuration object.

### **5. Development Workflow**

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Use `main` for production-ready code.
   - Use `develop` for integrating features before release.
   - Create feature branches (`feature/<feature-name>`) for new functionality.
2. **Code Reviews**:
   - All pull requests must be reviewed and approved before merging.
   - Ensure code follows naming conventions and best practices.

---

### **6. Best Practices**

- **Modularity**:
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
  - Use helper utilities for reusable logic (e.g., `d3Helpers.js`).
- **Documentation**:
  - Maintain clear inline comments and file-level descriptions.
  - Use JSDoc for detailed function and module documentation.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Ensure all API responses include meaningful error messages.
  - Use try-catch blocks to handle unexpected errors.
