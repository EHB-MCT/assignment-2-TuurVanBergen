## **Progress Log**

### **Project Initialization**

**Project Name:** VibeView  
**Date Initialized:** January 2, 2025  
**Goal:** Build a web application to collect user data via a frontend form, store it in a backend database, and visualize it interactively.  
**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, D3.js (for visualization).

---

### **Folder Structure**

#### **Frontend**

- **`src/`:**  
  Contains the React application source code. Includes directories for:

  - **`components/`:** Reusable UI components (e.g., `MusicForm`, `FormField`).
  - **`pages/`:** Page-specific components (e.g., `HomePage`, `VisualizationsPage`).
  - **`styles/`:** CSS/SCSS files for global and component-level styling.
  - **`routes/`:** Manages application routing logic.
  - **`hooks/`:** Custom React hooks for managing state and logic.
  - **`utils/`:** Shared utilities for validation, formatting, and data transformations.

- **`public/`:**  
  Static assets for the frontend (e.g., images, favicon).

#### **Backend**

- **`config/`:**  
  Configuration files (e.g., environment variables, database connections).

- **`src/`:**  
  Backend application logic, structured into:

  - **`controllers/`:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - **`routes/`:** API route definitions (e.g., `/api/tracks`, `/api/spotify`).
  - **`models/`:** Database schemas and models for MongoDB.
  - **`services/`:** Encapsulates business logic and data handling.
  - **`utils/`:** Reusable utility functions (e.g., validation, error handling).

### **Progress Updates**

#### **January 2, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

- **Project Initialization:**

  - Created separate folder structures for frontend and backend to ensure modularity.
  - Initialized React frontend using Vite for faster development.
  - Configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
  - Created a backend structure aligned with MVC principles.

- **Frontend Setup:**

  - Implemented routing with `react-router-dom` for navigation between pages.
  - Created placeholder pages (`HomePage`, `AboutPage`, `VisualizationsPage`, `NotFoundPage`).

- **Backend Setup:**
  - Defined folder hierarchy for `controllers`, `routes`, `models`, and `utils`.
  - Connected MongoDB using `mongoose`.

#### **January 3, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

##### **Frontend:**

- Developed the `MusicForm` component for data collection:

  - Added fields for track details such as `title`, `artist`, `album`, `year`, `genre`, `duration`, and `rating`.
  - Used `useMusicForm` hook to manage form state, validation, and submission logic.
  - Created a reusable `FormField` component.
  - Centralized field configurations in `formFieldsConfig` for easier updates.

- Added basic validation using the `validateMusicForm` utility:
  - Validated required fields, value ranges, and input formats.

##### **Backend:**

- Created `TrackSchema` in `models/track.js`:

  - Defined validation for fields (e.g., `year` between 1500 and current year, `rating` between 1 and 5).
  - Automatically tracked creation and update timestamps.

- Implemented API routes:
  - `GET /api/tracks`: Fetch all tracks.
  - `POST /api/tracks`: Add a new track to the database.

#### **January 4, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

##### **Spotify Integration:**

- Added `SpotifySearchInput` component for dynamic track suggestions:
  - Integrated Spotify API via a backend proxy.
  - Displayed search results in a dropdown.
  - Autofilled form fields upon track selection.

##### **Backend Enhancements:**

- Created `/api/spotify/search` endpoint:
  - Acts as a proxy for Spotify API requests.
  - Secures API credentials by handling authentication server-side.

##### **Frontend Integration:**

- Connected frontend to backend:
  - Used `GET` requests to fetch all tracks and display them on the `VisualizationsPage`.
  - Used `POST` requests to submit form data for storage in MongoDB.

#### **January 5, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

##### **Data Visualization:**

- Created interactive visualizations:

  - `MoodActivityChart`: Stacked bar chart showing mood distribution across activities.
  - `MoodEnergyScatter`: Scatter plot visualizing energy levels vs. duration.

- Implemented reusable D3 helpers:
  - `drawAxes`: Draws x and y axes.
  - `addTooltip`: Adds interactive tooltips.
  - `drawLegend`: Creates dynamic legends.

##### **Refactoring:**

- Modularized reusable logic into `d3Helpers.js`.
- Added comprehensive inline comments and JSDoc-style documentation across all modules.

##### **Validation Enhancements:**

- Improved form validation:
  - Ensured valid numeric ranges for fields like `rating` and `year`.
  - Added real-time validation feedback.

---

#### **January 6, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

##### **Final Updates:**

- Finalized documentation:
  - Updated README with setup instructions, naming conventions, and contribution guidelines.
  - Added API documentation for all endpoints, including Spotify integration and data visualization.
