# Progress Log

## Project Initialization

**Project Name:** Personal Data Form with Backend Integration  
**Date Initialized:** January 2, 2025  
**Goal:** Build a web application to collect user data via a frontend form, store it in a backend database, and visualize it interactively.  
**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, D3.js (for visualization).

---

## Folder Structure

### Frontend

- **`src/`:**  
  Contains the React application source code. Includes directories for:

  - **`components/`:** Reusable UI components.
  - **`pages/`:** Page-specific components (e.g., Home, About, Visualization).
  - **`styles/`:** CSS/SCSS files for global and component-level styling.
  - **`routes/`:** Manages application routing logic.

- **`public/`:**  
  Static assets for the frontend (e.g., images, favicon).

- **`tests/`:**  
  Testing scripts for validating frontend functionality.

---

### Backend

- **`config/`:**  
  Configuration files (e.g., environment variables, database connections).

- **`src/`:**  
  Backend application logic, structured into:

  - **`controllers/`:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - **`routes/`:** API route definitions (e.g., `/api/data`).
  - **`models/`:** Database schemas and models for MongoDB.
  - **`services/`:** Encapsulates business logic and data handling.
  - **`utils/`:** Reusable utility functions (e.g., validation, error handling).

- **`tests/`:**  
  Backend unit and integration tests.

## Progress Updates

### January 2, 2025

**Tasks Completed:**

- **Project Initialization:**

  - Defined separate folder structures for frontend and backend to ensure modularity.
  - Initialized React frontend using `vite` for faster development.
  - Configured ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
  - Created backend structure and aligned it with best practices.

- **Frontend Setup:**

  - Implemented a basic layout for the React application with routing (`react-router-dom`).
  - Created placeholders for `HomePage`, `AboutPage`, `VisualizationsPage` and `NotFoundPage`.

- **Backend Setup:**
  - Defined folder hierarchy for `controllers`, `routes`, `models`, `services`, and `utils`.

**Challenges:**

- Ensuring the frontend and backend structures remain scalable and follow conventions.
- Deciding on the tools for visualization.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Frontend Development:**

   - Build the React form to collect data fields from users.
   - Style the form using global and component-specific CSS.

2. **Backend Development:**

   - Implement routes to handle form submissions and validate incoming data.
   - Connect to MongoDB and create a schema for storing user-submitted data.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Begin exploring D3.js to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.

### Notes

- Changes and progress are documented in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
