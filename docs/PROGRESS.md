# Progress Log

## Project Initialization

**Project Name:** Personal Data Form with Backend Integration  
**Date Initialized:** January 2, 2025  
**Goal:** Build a web application that collects user data via a frontend form, stores it in a backend database, and visualizes it.  
**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, D3.js (for visualization).

### Folder Structure

#### Frontend

- `src/`: React application source code (components, pages, styles, etc.).
- `public/`: Static assets for the frontend.
- `tests/`: Testing scripts for frontend functionality.

#### Backend

- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., database connection, environment variables).
- `src/`: Backend application logic.
  - `controllers/`: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - `routes/`: API route definitions.
  - `models/`: Database models and schemas.
  - `services/`: Business logic and data operations.
  - `utils/`: Reusable utility functions (e.g., validation, error handling).
- `tests/`: Testing scripts for backend functionality.

## Progress Updates

### January 2, 2025

**Tasks Completed:**

- Initialized a new project structure for both frontend and backend.
- Set up the React frontend with `vite` for fast development.
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality.
- Created backend structure with `Express.js`:
  - Defined folder hierarchy for `controllers`, `routes`, `models`, `services`, and `utils`.

**Challenges:**

- Clarified the separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.
- Refined backend folder structure to align with best practices.

**Next Steps:**

- Build the React form for data collection (frontend).
- Create backend routes to handle form submissions and store data in MongoDB.
- Implement data fetching and visualization using D3.js in the frontend.

### Notes

- The new architecture follows modern conventions for full-stack JavaScript applications.
- Regular updates will be made to the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to reflect changes.
